        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Leandro, another designer who speaks with computers at work, or a self-taught software developer, or someone who studied design but never worked as a designer, or another guy who tries to understand science through arts (or, is it the other way around?), or yeah, you got the idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          I consider myself a fast learner and am able to easily solve challenges as they show up during any project, such as changes in the requirements, motivation in learning new technologies and tools, or being multifaceted with my tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Honestly, I like everything related with media arts and web-based technologies, and am curious by nature, that's why I'm always learning new tools and methodologies in order to apply in my daily work.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my career to date, I've been learning a variety of skills, from pixel perfectionism and new trends on web development, to database and IT administration, which gave me a range of opportunities to perform many different tasks with all the commitment and dedication it requires. Every little thing has its trick, and I always do my best to cover them all. You name it, I learn it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, spending my free time trying to understand what music is about with my piano and playing around with p5js & Processing (most the first than the second to be honest). Also I always have my Rubik's cube collection with me, just in case, you never know when apocalypse might come.

          I developed the new multidomain website, as the link between the Product, Marketing and IT teams. This project consisted of adapting all the requirements into a new CMS that is WYSIWYG, multisite and with a solid core, which why we chose Neos CMS, an open-source project based on PHP and TS2 that balances all of them. Later I developed all the templates in order to be useful within the system, and also helped the team in driving the technical aspect. Also, I was in charge of the documentation and training process for those who will use the system.
